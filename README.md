<h2>Required things to Install/Run Program</h2>

<p> These are the required installs for our program to install and run,
    this will be to run the dev version of our program as the final version
    will likely be hosted on github pages.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Node.js Version greater than or equal to 6.9.0</li>
    <li>NPM (should be installed with Node.js)</li>
    <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
    <li>Live Server extension for VSCode</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setting up Environment and Running Program Locally</h2>

<p> These are the steps to get the environment and program 
    set-up up and running. The process will be primarily for
    Windows with some deviations for Mac-OS and Linux. This 
    installation guide will expect basic understanding of 
    terminals and IDE usage.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Install Node.js (latest version can be found here: https://nodejs.org/en)</li>
    <li>After installation finishes use cmd/terminal to check node.js version using node -v command</li>
    <li>Ensure that NPM also properly installed by checking version using npm --v command</li>
    <li>After these are checked we can move onto installing Visual Studio Code, which can be downloaded here: https://code.visualstudio.com/ there are downloads for different operating systems so be sure to choose the correct version for your computer</li>
    <li>After VSCode is installed open it and head to the "Extensions" tab on the left side bar (it looks like 4 blocks, with 3 in an L shape and the fourth falling into place)</li>
    <li>From this tab install the Live Server Extension</li>
    <li>Then head to the github repo (Project Page) for this project and download the code</li>
    <li>Once the code is downloaded open it in VSCode and click the "Go Live" button in the bottom right of VSCode to start the local dev version of our program, from here any changes made will be viewable live on your default web browser as they happen thanks to the Live Server extension</li>
</ol>
