# Repository for JSDocs

Deciders Involved: Tyler Flar

Decided to make our JSDocs in a seperate respository because our linter detects problems with the automatically generated JSDocs. There is not much we can do about this, so we decided to put the JSDocs in a seperate repository. This way, we can still have the JSDocs in our project, but we can also have a clean linter.
